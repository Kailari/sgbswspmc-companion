# sgbswspmc-companion
SGBSWSPMC Modpack companion mod, containing tweaks and small nice-to-have features. What can be done via configs is very limited at times, especially when working with alpha/beta mods early in the cycle. Poking at things via code allows us to do some really nice things while waiting for mod developers to add features and config options.

## Current Features:
- Configurable BloodMagic LivingArmor upgrades (currently just jump and speed upgrades but more to come) [WIP]
- Advancements for BloodMagic (with custom advancement triggers!) [WIP]

## Planned/TODO:
- Advancements for other mods in the pack (namely Thaumcraft 6, Crossroads, Pam's Harvestcraft)
- Advancements for pack progression (what mods' content to turn to at different stages of the game)
- Vanity items
